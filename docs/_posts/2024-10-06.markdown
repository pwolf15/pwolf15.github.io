* what is arc-length parametrization?
* why is arc-length parametrization relevant to geometry processing?
* what is curvature?
* how can I compute curvature and magnitude of curvature for arbitrary parametric curve?
* visually, how can I classify points based on curvature of a 3D surface?
* 
* what is the relationship between the tangent and the curvature?
* why can we use the second derivative of the 1D curve to make statements about the curvature of the 1D surface?
