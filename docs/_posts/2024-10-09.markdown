* How to learn?

* I listened to a podcast from Peter K. Brown, who co-wrote `Make it Stick`, a book on the most effective strategies for learning. The core themes of his work:
    * effective learning is effortful; it should feel challenging.
    * retrieval practice is key; force yourself to retrieve the subject from memory
    * retrieval practice takes many forms
        * self-quizzing
        * explain it to yourself
            * Note, `5 elements of effective thinking` is similar here. Write out all you know about a subject and identify weaknesses.
        * explain it to others
    * try quizzing yourself, doing problems before reading/lecture
    * re-reading on its own is not an effective strategy
    * interrupt the process of forgetting
    * interleaving multiple subjects is more effective
