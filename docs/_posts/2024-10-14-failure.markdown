* `5 elements of effective thinking`:
    * How to improve insight?
        * Write down everything you know about a subject. This agrees with `Make It Stick` in that you are forcing retrieval.
        * Try doing the opposite. Hold the opposite opinion for an 1hr at a time, 15 minutes at a time.

* `Animal Farm`:
    * Animalism: avoid the instincts of men to enslave and exploit for labor

* Machine learning `Math refresher`
    * How can you determine the dimensionality of each variable in an expression?
        * Can you provide an example?
    * What must be true about each variable in `Ax=b` to ensure a unique solution `x`?
        * `A` must be square and full-rank. 
        * Can you provide a counter example that shows why both must be true?
    * What is rank?
        * rank refers to the number of independent rows and columns in a matrix. Independence requires that rows/columns are not linear combination of other rows/columns.
    * What is full-rank?
        * This contrasts to row rank/column rank where only rows/columns must be independent.
    * What is required for pseudo-inverse? What are applications?
        * Pseudo-inverse only requires row-rank.
